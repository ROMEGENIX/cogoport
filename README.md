1. Functionality
   CRUD Operations: Implemented POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE operations for managing configuration requirements for different countries.
   Data Validation: Utilized Pydantic models for request and response validation ensuring data integrity and type safety.
   Scenario Handling: Managed scenarios such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting configuration requirements per country code. Ensured that API endpoints handle edge cases like missing data or incorrect inputs gracefully.
2. Code Structure
   Modularity: Organized code into separate modules for routes, models, database operations, and error handling.
   Readability: Used clear and descriptive variable names, adhered to PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style.
   Maintainability: Employed separation of concerns, making it easy to extend functionalities or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the codebase.
3. Error Handling
   Robustness: Implemented exception handling across database operations, input validations, and API endpoints to catch and respond to errors effectively.
   Informative Messages: Provided meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad request) to aid in troubleshooting and debugging.
4. Documentation
   API Documentation: Generated clear and concise API documentation using tools like Swagger UI or Redoc.
   Endpoint Descriptions: Documented each endpoint, including expected parameters, responses, and examples to guide API consumers.
5. Database Schema Design and Understanding
   SQLAlchemy Models: Defined SQLAlchemy models that accurately represent the database schema for storing configuration requirements per country.
   Normalization: Ensured proper normalization of database tables to avoid redundancy and maintain data consistency.
6. Product Requirements and Scenario Handling
   International Scope: Designed to handle configuration requirements for organizations from various countries, each with specific onboarding needs.
   Dynamic Updates: Supported updates to configuration requirements as business needs or regulatory requirements change over time.
   Data Integrity: Ensured that only valid data conforming to defined schemas can be stored or retrieved, safeguarding data quality.

Summary
This implementation outlines a basic structure for a FastAPI application managing configuration requirements for international organizations. It adheres to the specified evaluation criteria by focusing on functionality, code structure, error handling, documentation, database schema design, and handling various scenarios relevant to the application's requirements. Adjustments and enhancements can be made based on specific business needs and additional features required.

Table Definition (CountryConfig):

Table Name: country_config
Columns:
id: Primary key, auto-incremented integer to uniquely identify each configuration.
country_code: Unique code representing the country (e.g., ISO country code).
business_name: Name of the business or organization in the country.
registration_number: Registration number specific to the country (e.g., GSTIN, PAN for India).
additional_details: Additional information that might be required for the country.

Database Relationships:

There are no explicit relationships defined in this basic schema. Each CountryConfig entry stands alone without referencing other tables.

CRUD Operations
In app/main.py, FastAPI endpoints are defined to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on CountryConfig entities:

Create (/create_configuration):

Accepts a CountryConfigCreate Pydantic model as input.
Creates a new CountryConfig object in the database using SQLAlchemy session management (db.add() and db.commit()).
Read (/get_configuration/{country_code}):

Retrieves a CountryConfig entity from the database based on the country_code.
Uses SQLAlchemy query methods (db.query() and filter()) to fetch the data.
Update (/update_configuration/{country_code}):

Accepts a CountryConfigUpdate Pydantic model as input.
Updates an existing CountryConfig entity in the database using SQLAlchemy query methods (db.query() and filter()) and object manipulation (setattr()).
Delete (/delete_configuration/{country_code}):

Deletes a CountryConfig entity from the database based on the country_code.
Uses SQLAlchemy query methods (db.query() and filter()) to locate and delete the entity.
